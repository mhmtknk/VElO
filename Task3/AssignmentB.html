            <p>Inspired by a trip to the library of Fonmon castle, this layout is inspired by the large collection of
                18th century volumes there. Designed around an asymmetric five column grid, the first and last columns
                are two hundred pixels wide. The centre three are ninety six pixels wide each. The gutters are thirty
                pixels. The centre three columns can be combined to one master column – like the one you’re now
                reading. This can comfortably contain a three hundred pixel wide advertising unit.
